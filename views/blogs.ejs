                                    <br>Limiting access to food in mice increases levels of the hormone, ghrelin, which may
                                    also increase motivation to exercise, according to a study published in the Journal
                                    of Endocrinology. The study suggests that a surge in levels of appetite-promoting
                                    hormone, ghrelin, after a period of fasting prompted mice to initiate voluntary
                                    exercise. These novel findings indicate that better diet control, for example
                                    limiting food intake to mealtimes or fasting intermittently, could help overweight
                                    people maintain a more effective exercise routine, lose weight and avoid
                                    debilitating complications such as diabetes and heart disease.

                                    <br><br> Obesity is a costly and growing, global health epidemic that needs more effective
                                    intervention strategies to avoid serious complications including heart disease and
                                    diabetes. Food restriction and regular exercise are the two main cost-effective
                                    strategies to prevent and treat obesity; however the condition is often associated
                                    with a sedentary lifestyle and bad eating habits, such as snacking and binge eating.
                                    Consequently, adhering to a regular exercise regime can be difficult due to an
                                    inability to exercise for a prolonged period or a lack of motivation. Ghrelin, often
                                    referred to as the 'hunger hormone', stimulates appetite through actions on the
                                    brain reward circuitry that increase motivation to eat. It has also been reported to
                                    be essential for endurance exercise by increasing metabolism to meet the energy
                                    demands of prolonged exercise. Although previous studies have suggested a
                                    relationship between ghrelin and exercise, it is not known whether ghrelin levels
                                    have a direct effect on motivation to exercise.

                                    <br><br>In this study, Dr Yuji Tajiri and colleagues from Kurume University School of
                                    Medicine in Japan, investigated the relationship between exercise and ghrelin levels
                                    in mice. Food intake and wheel-running activity were compared in mice given free
                                    access to food and those fed only twice a day for a limited time. Although both
                                    groups ate a similar amount of food, the restricted mice ran significantly more.
                                    Mice genetically altered to have no ghrelin and on the restricted feeding diet ran
                                    less than the mice given free access, however, this could be reversed by
                                    administering ghrelin. Furthermore, mice given free access to food and given ghrelin
                                    also ran significantly more. These findings suggest that ghrelin may play an
                                    important role in the motivation for both feeding and exercise, in response to
                                    restricted eating plans.

                                    <br><br>Dr Tajiri comments, "Our findings suggest that hunger, which promotes ghrelin
                                    production, may also be involved in increasing motivation for voluntary exercise,
                                    when feeding is limited. Therefore, maintaining a healthy eating routine, with
                                    regular mealtimes or fasting, could also encourage motivation for exercise in
                                    overweight people."

                                    <br><br>However, Dr Tajiri cautions. "These findings and previous reports are based on
                                    animal studies; so much more work is needed to confirm that this ghrelin response is
                                    also present in people. If it can be established in clinical practice, it not only
                                    opens up new cost-effective diet and exercise strategies but may also indicate a new
                                    therapeutic application for ghrelin-mimicking drugs."

                                    <br><br>Dr Tajiri and his team now plan to carry out more experiments to confirm these
                                    findings in humans, to further characterise how ghrelin acts in the brain to produce
                                    motivation to eat or exercise and to explore any potential real-world, clinical
                                    benefits for the treatment and prevention of obesity.
